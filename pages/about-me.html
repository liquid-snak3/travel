        <h1><i>Resume</i></h1>
        <h2>Hello! My name is <br> Chris Adeoye</h2>
        <p>Born in New York, raised in Atlanta. My love for technology started at an early age. i started simple html/css coding in highschool. at that time i hadnt noticed that design and development was a passion of mine. i took a job my first year of college at <i></i>Georgia State</i> doing some data entry/I.T, with the occasional updating and testing with oversight from the senior developers.  </p><br>
        <p> i worked my up to a junior designer position at <i>Hydrosystems international</i> until it was time for me to develop some more technical skills for my portfolio. I then got hired as a junior /dev at <i>Tactical armour group</i> where it was a beautiful educational environment. There i had the chance to understand the higher order mechanics of Javascript coupled with some mySQl.</p><br>
        <p> I am currently working on my own freelance development business while also working on diversifying my portfolio with react.js and python in my spare time. i see myself as a passionate creative who always eager to learn more about the industry's best practices. i believe that web design is meant to be simple, elegant, and serve a purpose that has been defined than expressed succintly. </p>
